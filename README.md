# World-Weather-Comparison-
World Weather Comparison using EDA

### AIM OF THE PROJECT
Build a real-time weather dataset of the top 10 countries(based on their GDP(economy) index, https://www.investopedia.com/insights/worlds-top-economies/) of the world such as 1. the United States, 2. China, 3.Japan, 4. Germany, 5. India, 6. The United Kingdom, 7. France, 8.  Italy,  9.Brazil,  10.  Canada. 

#### Collect  weather  data(of  all  the states  and  cities  of  the  top  10  countries)  such  as  temperature, humidity,  windspeed  of  July  2020
#### (AccuWeather.com). Compile   them   in   10   different.csv   files   and   caption   it   as 'Country_Name_Weather_July.csv'.
Also,  create  10 data  frames for each country and name it as Country_Name_Dt. 
#### Perform the following tasks on the created data frames(hint: pivot, merge, or pivot table functions can be used as when required):
 - 1.1Group all the data frames by states and find the maximum, minimum,  and  average  temperature,  humidity,  and  wind speed  values  of  each  state  separately.  Plot  all  the  values using an appropriate graphical representation.
 - 1.2Group all the data frames by cities and find the maximum, minimum,  and  average  temperature,  humidity,  and  wind speed values of each cityseparately. Plot all the values using an appropriate graphical representation.
 - 1.3Merge all the weather data frames of the top 10 countries of the world and caption it as 'world_weather_comparison.csv'.   Prepare   a   comparison table  where  the  x-axis  represents  'date'  and  the  y-axis-represents 'state', 'temperature', 'humidity',and 'wind speed' and vice versa. Apply the pivot table function and find the overall mean and sum values of temperature, humidity, and wind speed as well.
 - 1.4Merge all the weather data frames of the top 10 countries of the world and caption it as 
'world_weather_comparison.csv'.  

#### Prepare   a   comparison table  where  the  x-axis  represents  'date'  andthe  y-axis-represents 'cityâ€™, 'temperature', 'humidity', and 'wind speed' and vice versa.
Apply the pivot table function and find the overall mean and sum values of temperature, humidity, and wind speed as well.
